Data Structures, Algorithms & C++ Programs

This repository contains my practice and implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms along with various C++ programs that strengthen my programming fundamentals.
As a B.Tech student specializing in AI and ML, I use this repository to systematically build my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts.
It includes structured, topic-wise solutions written primarily in C and C++, along with selected implementations in Python.
Wherever applicable, I focus on writing optimized solutions with proper time and space complexity analysis.

The repository covers fundamental and advanced topics such as time and space complexity, recursion, bit manipulation, arrays (searching, sorting, prefix sum, sliding window, two-pointer technique), 
strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary trees, BST, traversals, LCA), heaps, graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, topological sort), and
dynamic programming (memoization, tabulation, knapsack, LIS, matrix chain multiplication). In addition, it includes standalone C++ programs that help reinforce object-oriented programming concepts, STL usage, and core programming logic.

The main goal of this repository is to continuously improve my coding skills, prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming,
and track my learning progress in a structured manner. I regularly solve problems from platforms such as LeetCode, CodeStudio, CodeChef, and HackerRank to maintain consistency
and challenge myself with diverse problem sets. This repository will keep evolving as I explore more advanced topics and refine my coding techniques.
